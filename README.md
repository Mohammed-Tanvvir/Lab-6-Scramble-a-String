# Scramble-a-String
Objective: Write a function that accepts a string and scrambles it. The function should return the scrambled string. The scrambling method can vary, but it should follow a specific pattern, such as rearranging every other letter or alternating between the first and last letters.

Requirements
Function Definition: Create a function that accepts a single string argument.

Scrambling Logic: Implement a scrambling pattern. You can choose from one of the following examples or create your own:
- Take every other letter from the string. For example, if given "Apples", the function would return "Apepls", taking the 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters first, then the 2nd, 4th, and 6th letters.
- Alternate between the first and last letters, then the second and second-to-last letters, and so on. For example, if given "Apples", the function might return "AelpPs".

Return Value: The function should return the scrambled string.
